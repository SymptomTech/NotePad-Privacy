    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: December 13, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the NotePad application ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information Collected by the App</h3>
    <p><strong>The App does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.</strong></p>
    
    <p>All data you create in the App is stored locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Note titles and content</li>
        <li>Checklist items</li>
        <li>Categories and organization preferences</li>
        <li>App settings and customization preferences</li>
        <li>Theme and font preferences</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party by the App itself.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The free version of the App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and process certain information to deliver personalized advertisements. This information may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Device type and operating system</li>
        <li>App usage information</li>
        <li>General location information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For more information about how Google AdMob collects and processes data, please review Google's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and their partner policies at <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, access, or use any of your personal information. Your notes and data remain entirely private and local to your device. The App does not require an account, does not authenticate users, and does not sync data to any cloud service.</p>
    
    <p>Third-party advertising services (Google AdMob) use the information they collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deliver and personalize advertisements</li>
        <li>Measure ad performance</li>
        <li>Provide analytics and insights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All notes and app data are stored locally on your device using secure Android storage mechanisms (Room database). Your data is only accessible by the App and is protected by your device's security features (such as device encryption and lock screen protection).</p>
    
    <p>We do not have access to your notes or any data stored within the App. If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be permanently deleted from your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer any of your personal information to third parties because we do not collect any personal information in the first place.</p>
    
    <p>The only data sharing that occurs is through Google AdMob's advertising network in the free version of the App. AdMob operates independently and is subject to Google's privacy policies and data practices. You can control ad personalization through your device settings or by removing ads through the in-app purchase.</p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers an optional one-time in-app purchase to remove advertisements permanently. This purchase is processed through Google Play's billing system. When you make a purchase:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play handles all payment processing and billing information</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your payment details or financial information</li>
        <li>Your purchase status is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>Google's Privacy Policy governs how Google Play processes your payment information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Since the App does not collect any personal information and all data remains local to the device, it can be safely used by children under parental supervision. However, parents should be aware that the free version displays advertisements through Google AdMob, which may collect device information as described in Section 1.2.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Control:</strong> You have complete control over your data. You can delete individual notes, clear all data, or uninstall the App at any time to permanently remove all local data.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Ad Personalization:</strong> You can limit ad tracking and personalization through your device settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Android: Settings > Privacy > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li>Or reset your advertising ID in the same menu</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Remove Ads:</strong> You can permanently remove all advertisements and eliminate third-party data collection by purchasing the ad-free version through the in-app purchase option.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Export and Backup</h2>
    <p>The App provides export and backup functionality that allows you to save your notes as a ZIP file on your device. These exports contain only your note data and are stored locally on your device. You control where these backup files are stored and whether to share them with other apps or services.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and will take effect immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>This App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Google AdMob</strong></p>
    <ul>

However, Google AdMob may transfer data internationally as part of their advertising operations. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information about their data transfer practices.</p>
